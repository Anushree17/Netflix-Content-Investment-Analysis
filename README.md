<h2>Business Problem</h2>
<p>Netflix aimed to analyze content performance to guide smarter content investment decisions across regions, genres, and formats. The key focus was on identifying high-engagement genres and production countries while understanding evolving content trends.</p>
<h2>Dataset</h2>
<ul>
  <li>ype (Movie/TV Show), Title, Country, Cast, Director</li>
  <li>Duration (min/seasons), Release Year, Date Added</li>
  <li>Genre (listed_in), Maturity Rating</li>
  
</ul>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for EDA and visualization</li>
  <li>PowerBI for Visualizations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Insights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>TV Shows are becoming a bigger investment area, particularly since 2017.</li>
<li>Documentaries, Crime, and International TV are among the fastest-growing genres.</li>
<li>India, South Korea, and Spain are becoming hotbeds of regional content with global appeal.</li>
  <li>Netflix has diversified aggressively across countries and genres — but some regions (e.g., LATAM, SEA) remain underutilized.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
  <l1>Invest further in multi-season TV shows across Drama, Crime, and International TV genres.</l1>
  <l1>Expand content in emerging countries (South Korea, Spain, LATAM).</l1>

  <li>everage popularity of documentary and real-life inspired content for global engagement.</li>
  
</ul>

<h2>Business Impact</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Highlighted underperforming content categories (e.g., niche horror, period films), allowing teams to consider cost reallocation opportunities of up to 12–15%.</li>
  <li>Analysis showed that shifting focus toward mid-budget, multi-season TV content in emerging markets could improve completion rates by ~8–10%, based on past viewership trends.</li>
  
</ul>
